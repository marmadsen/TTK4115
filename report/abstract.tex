This report documents the work done in the course Linear System Theory at NTNU in the fall of 2017. We develop a mathematical model for our helicopter system, linearize it, and apply mono-variable control to it. However, the bulk of the report covers multi-variable control and state-estimation since that is the main focus of this course. The goal of the different control-methods are to provide as fast and accurate control over the helicopter as possible, as well as being a robust controller.
